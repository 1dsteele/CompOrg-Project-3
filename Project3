#Assume your Howard ID as a decimal integer is X. Let N =26 + (X % 11) where % is the modulo operation, and M = N – 10.
#You will write a MIPS program that reads a string of up to 1000 characters from user input.
#With single comma as the delimiter, split the input string into multiple substrings (with the
#comma removed). If there is no comma in the input, the whole input string is considered a
#substring referred to below.
#For each substring, remove the leading and trailing blank spaces and tab characters if any.
#After that
#If the substring has zero characters or more than 4 characters or has at least one illegal
#character (a character outside the set described below), the program prints a question
#mark "?" as an error message.
#If the substring has only the characters from '0' to '9' and from 'a' to β and from 'A' to
#Δ, the program prints out the number of digits and a slash ‘/’, followed by the unsigned
#decimal integer corresponding to the base-N number represented by the substring. β
#stands for the M-th lower case letter and Δ stands for the M-th upper case letter in the
#English alphabet. In a base-N number, both 'a' and 'A' correspond to the decimal integer
#of 10, both 'b' and 'B' to 11, and so on, and both β and Δ correspond to N – 1.
#o If  there  are  multiple  substrings,  the  numbers  and  the  error  message  should  be
#separated by a single comma.
#Sample test cases (assuming the Howard ID is 12345678):
#02821059 % 11 = 10, therefore the base is 26 + 10 = 36, β is 't' and Δ is 'T'
